There is a great deal of web development learning material on the internet, and it often helps to pay for the premium content. Here are some of the best tutorial courses from as cheap as $10.

## Udemy
Udemy is an excellent platform with an enormous variety of tutorials, usually in the affordable $10-12 range. Video series range from on average 15-30 hours of content with ratings and thorough descriptions. Its safe to say that there are probably at least two Udemy courses for any specific topic you're looking for. 
&nbsp;
Udemy is great for sampling a wide range of material affordably and potentially finding a great deal on a full length introductory course. With too many quality instructors to name here, I recommend watching the free introduction videos for highly rated or relavant material.

## Levelup Tuts
Levelup tutorials is a longtime youtube channel with countless videos on a wide variety of topics. In addition to that, it is also a premium tutorial series platform with a new ~5 hour video course every month. Levelup tuts was made by Scott Tolinski who is really great at introducing new web technologies in an approachable and relevant way.
&nbsp;
There are so many approachable topics here that you could learn for a while on the Levelup subscription. I find the monthly subscription useful when there are a handful of courses I'd like to take over a few weeks without having to make a full year long commitment.
&nbsp;
The quality of Levelup Tuts is excellent, and definitely worth trying for at least a month!

## Wes Bos
Wes Bos is another web developer who has been making excellent JavaScript courses now for years. Wes alternates between creating free and paid courses, so you can try half of his courses out for free. The premium courses tend to be more in-demand skills, though there is plenty to learn for any developer in the free courses as well.
&nbsp;
I highly recommend the Beginner Javascript course if you're starting out and the Advanced React and Learn Node Courses if you have a little experience. While they are a bit pricier at $50-100 each, you get video download for life and the quality is excellent. Wes also re-records courses if they are useful and packages become outdated.

## Frontend Masters
Frontend Masters is a platform with courses by well known and interesting developers in a wide variety of topics. Courses are generally lecture style and come with thoroughly detailed code to reference. There are plenty of advanced ideas and concepts here to learn about and explore.
&nbsp;
Frontend Master is always growing and coming out with new and innovative content. This platform is also a monthly subscription at around $40/month and certainly worth trying at least once!
