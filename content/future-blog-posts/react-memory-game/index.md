Building games is made easier with React, and in this tutorial we will be creating a basic memory game.

&nbsp;

In this tutorial we will be using **NextJS** for an easy React setup and **React Spring** for the card rotate animation. The only require for this tutorial is that you have **Node** installed ([download here]([Download | Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))).

## Memory Game Rules

The game of memory involves selecting two squares at a time from a group of squares trying to find a match. These are a few details we can plan out now before setting up the game.

- Even number (n) of squares

- Different image or color for every 2 squares (n / 2 options)

- Each involves turn is 2 choices (unlimited turns)

- Cards only stay flipped over when 2 match

- Game ends when all matches occur (n / 2) matches
