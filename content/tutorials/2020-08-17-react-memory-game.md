React makes building games on the web easier, and in this tutorial we will be creating a memory game from scratch.  
&nbsp;   
Here is a preview of what the [game](https://memory-game.peterdurham.now.sh/) will look like:

![Memory Game Preview](/img/memory_game_preview.jpg)

We will be using **NextJS** for our React setup and **React Spring**
for the card rotate animation. The only requirement for this tutorial is that you have
[Node JS installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Memory Game Rules

The game of memory involves selecting two squares from a group of squares in attempt to
find a match. These are a few details we can plan out now before setting up the game.

- Game has an even number (n) of squares

- Different color for every 2 squares (n / 2 options)

- Each turn the user gets 2 choices (unlimited turns)

- Cards only stay flipped over when 2 match

- Game ends when all matches occur (n / 2) matches

## React Setup

Let's start by creating a React application using `create-next-app`

```bash
npx create-next-app memory-game
```

Next let's change directory into this project and install
[React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) for our card animation with the commands

```bash
cd memory-game
npm install react-spring
```

Our project is now configured and we can start it in the browser with

```bash
npm run dev
```

visit the running project at `http://localhost:3000/`

## Memory Game Logic

The basic architecture for this project will be:

- an `App` parent component for the main menu
- a `MemoryGame` child component to load the game in
- a `Card` grandchild component to populate the game with

### Step 1: Main Menu

Let's start by creating the `App` component with our basic menu logic. Replace the code in `index.js` in the *pages* folder with the following.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useSpring, animated as a } from "react-spring";

export default function App() {
  const [options, setOptions] = useState(null)
  const [highScore, setHighScore] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Loads when the game starts
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="container">
        <h1>Memory Game</h1>
        <div>High Score: {highScore}</div>
        <div>
          {options === null ? (
            <>
              <button onClick={() => setOptions(12)}>Easy</button>
              <button onClick={() => setOptions(18)}>Medium</button>
              <button onClick={() => setOptions(24)}>Hard</button>
            </>
          ) : (
            <>
              <button
                onClick={() => {
                  const prevOptions = options
                  setOptions(null)
                  setTimeout(() => {
                    setOptions(prevOptions)
                  }, 5)
                }}
              >
                Start Over
              </button>
              <button onClick={() => setOptions(null)}>Main Menu</button>
            </>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>

      {options ? (
        <MemoryGame
          options={options}
          setOptions={setOptions}
          highScore={highScore}
          setHighScore={setHighScore}
        />
      ) : (
        <h2>Choose a difficulty to begin!</h2>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

function MemoryGame(props) {
  return <div>Game goes here</div>
}
```

Above we scaffolded out a menu component which relies on the `options` value in state.
This variable will determine whether the user is playing a game and which difficulty it
is. An _unstarted_ game is considered `null`, while a _current_ game can be `12`, `18`, or
`24` depending on how many tiles you want to guess. We also added a `highScore` useState
hook and an empty `useEffect` hook we come go back to later.  
&nbsp;   
Next, we conditionally rendered 5 different _settings_ buttons depending on whether the
options were set (and the game started). If no game has been started the user can select
from **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. If the user has already started a game, they can
either _start over_ the current game or return to the _main menu_. The _Start Over_ button
utilizes a short (5ms) timeout in order to trigger a new game as otherwise the cards would
have the same props and _not reset_.   
&nbsp;  
Lastly we render out a `MemoryGame` component if the options exist, and a main menu
message otherwise.

### Step 2: Game Board

Now that we've setup the menu logic, we can add a basic game board to the application.
This board will accept the number of `options` as props and render that many game cards.
The `MemoryGame` component will keep track of the current _game state_, the _number of
attempts_ made, and the _indexes_ of the cards that were guessed.  
&nbsp;  
Replace the
`MemoryGame` placeholder component from above with the following

```javascript
function MemoryGame({options, setOptions, highScore, setHighScore}) {
  const [game, setGame] = useState([])
  const [flippedCount, setFlippedCount] = useState(0)
  const [flippedIndexes, setFlippedIndexes] = useState([])

  const colors = [
    '#ecdb54',
    '#e34132',
    '#6ca0dc',
    '#944743',
    '#dbb2d1',
    '#ec9787',
    '#00a68c',
    '#645394',
    '#6c4f3d',
    '#ebe1df',
    '#bc6ca7',
    '#bfd833',
  ]

  useEffect(() => {
    const newGame = []
    for (let i = 0; i < options / 2; i++) {
      const firstOption = {
        id: 2 * i,
        colorId: i,
        color: colors[i],
        flipped: false,
      }
      const secondOption = {
        id: 2 * i + 1,
        colorId: i,
        color: colors[i],
        flipped: false,
      }

      newGame.push(firstOption)
      newGame.push(secondOption)
    }

    const shuffledGame = newGame.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)
    setGame(shuffledGame)
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    // Loads when the game variable changes
  }, [game])

  if (flippedIndexes.length === 2) {
    // Runs if two cards have been flipped
  }

  if (game.length === 0) return <div>loading...</div>
  else {
    return (
      <div id="cards">
        {game.map((card, index) => (
          <div className="card" key={index}>
            <Card
              id={index}
              color={card.color}
              game={game}
              flippedCount={flippedCount}
              setFlippedCount={setFlippedCount}
              flippedIndexes={flippedIndexes}
              setFlippedIndexes={setFlippedIndexes}
            />
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

function Card(props) {
  return <div>i'm a card</div>
}
```

This component creates and renders our game board. The `game` variable is an array with
length equal to the number stored in the `options` variable.  
&nbsp;  
The `useEffect` hook runs here when the component renders and randomly assigns
`options / 2` colors out to all the cards. Each card also has a `flipped` property to
track if has been matched already, and a `colorId` property to help with the matching.
Lastly the cards are shuffled using **Math.random()** and the game is set.  
&nbsp;  
Below that we included an empty `useEffect` hook which we will use later on to track our
game logic. Above the return statement we also included a loading state so that the game
only renders when the cards have been assigned color pairs (`game.length > 0`).  
&nbsp;   
Lastly we render out the cards (objects in the `game` array) with _map_. We also passed
down the `color`, `game`, and both of our _flipped_ hooks to each of the cards to use in
the _click handlers_ we will soon set up.


### Step 3: Adding Styles

Before we continue building the game, let's add some styles so we can see what we're working with. **Next JS**
allows you to add inline CSS styles with their `<style>` tag. Add the following just below
the closing `</div>` of the `App` component.

```jsx
<style jsx global>
  {`
    body {
      text-align: center;
      font-family: -apple-system, sans-serif;
    }
    .container {
      width: 1060px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      align-items: center;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    button {
      background: #00ad9f;
      border-radius: 4px;
      font-weight: 700;
      color: #fff;
      border: none;
      padding: 7px 15px;
      margin-left: 8px;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
    button:hover {
      background: #008378;
    }
    button:focus {
      outline: 0;
    }
    #cards {
      width: 1060px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    .card {
      width: 160px;
      height: 160px;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    .card:not(:nth-child(6n)) {
      margin-right: 20px;
    }

    .c {
      position: absolute;
      max-width: 160px;
      max-height: 160px;
      width: 50ch;
      height: 50ch;
      cursor: pointer;
      will-change: transform, opacity;
    }

    .front,
    .back {
      background-size: cover;
    }

    .back {
      background-image: url(https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544511916-0148ccdeb877?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&w=1901&q=80i&auto=format&fit=crop);
    }

    .front {
      background-image: url(https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540206395-68808572332f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&w=1181&q=80&auto=format&fit=crop);
    }
  `}
</style>
```

### Step 4: Card Setup

React Spring has great
[animation examples](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/examples) in their docs, and
for this project we will be using their
[Flip Card Animation](https://codesandbox.io/embed/01yl7knw70) example as reference. Set
up the `Card` component now by replacing the placeholder (at the bottom) with

```javascript
function Card({
  id,
  color,
  game,
  flippedCount,
  setFlippedCount,
  flippedIndexes,
  setFlippedIndexes,
}) {
  const [flipped, set] = useState(false)
  const {transform, opacity} = useSpring({
    opacity: flipped ? 1 : 0,
    transform: `perspective(600px) rotateX(${flipped ? 180 : 0}deg)`,
    config: {mass: 5, tension: 500, friction: 80},
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Flipped Indexes Changed')
  }, [flippedIndexes])

  const onCardClick = () => {
    console.log('Card Clicked')
    set(state => state)
  }

  return (
    <div onClick={onCardClick}>
      <a.div
        className="c back"
        style={{
          opacity: opacity.interpolate(o => 1 - o),
          transform,
        }}
      />
      <a.div
        className="c front"
        style={{
          opacity,
          transform: transform.interpolate(t => `${t} rotateX(180deg)`),
          background: color,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Each card will also have a `flipped` value on the individual component. This value works
with the `useSpring` hook below it to implement the flipping card animation.  
&nbsp;  
We also included a `useEffect` hook and a `onCardClick` method which we will be adding
logic to. The Card's jsx includes styles for the front and back of each card. We will
apply a background image to the _back_ of every card and a background color to the
_front_.  
&nbsp;  
These cards can be flipped over by running `set((state) => !state)`, like in the
`onCardClick` method. If you start a game in the browser now the cards will be flippable.

### Step 5: Click Logic

Now that we can click all of the cards, it makes sense to add some JavaScript that will
check whether they are allowed to be flipped. If a card has already been guessed or
matched, we wouldn't want to flip it again! To avoid these concerns we can update the
`flippedCount` and `flippedIndexes` values that we inherited from the `MemoryGame`
component.  
&nbsp;  
The `flippedCount` variable will increase by _one_ each time either:

- The first guess is flipped
- The second guess is flipped
- The two cards match or don't match The `flippedIndexes` variable will push the index of
  a flipped card. When two cards are flipped, if they are a match we will push `false` as
  the third entry in this array to avoid a reset. If they are not a match we will instead
  push `true` and trigger both cards to flip back over. &nbsp;  
  Replace the `onCardClick` method in the `Card` component with

```javascript
const onCardClick = () => {
  if (!game[id].flipped && flippedCount % 3 === 0) {
    set(state => !state)
    setFlippedCount(flippedCount + 1)
    const newIndexes = [...flippedIndexes]
    newIndexes.push(id)
    setFlippedIndexes(newIndexes)
  } else if (
    flippedCount % 3 === 1 &&
    !game[id].flipped &&
    flippedIndexes.indexOf(id) < 0
  ) {
    set(state => !state)
    setFlippedCount(flippedCount + 1)
    const newIndexes = [...flippedIndexes]
    newIndexes.push(id)
    setFlippedIndexes(newIndexes)
  }
}
```

This method will act on two different conditions, the first and second valid clicks of
each turn. They each essentially do the same thing, updating the `MemoryGame` state
variables mentioned above. The second condition also checks that the first guess wasn't
guessed again.

### Step 6: Match Logic

Now that we've set a click listener to update our state, we can specify what happens to
the game when two indexes are added to `flippedIndexes`. We scaffolded this condition out
in the `MemoryGame` component earlier. Replace that empty code block with the following

```javascript
if (flippedIndexes.length === 2) {
  const match = game[flippedIndexes[0]].colorId === game[flippedIndexes[1]].colorId

  if (match) {
    const newGame = [...game]
    newGame[flippedIndexes[0]].flipped = true
    newGame[flippedIndexes[1]].flipped = true
    setGame(newGame)

    const newIndexes = [...flippedIndexes]
    newIndexes.push(false)
    setFlippedIndexes(newIndexes)
  } else {
    const newIndexes = [...flippedIndexes]
    newIndexes.push(true)
    setFlippedIndexes(newIndexes)
  }
}
```

When two cards are flipped they will either be a match or not, and we can check for that.
First we set a _boolean_ variable `match` to check whether the indexes of the cards we
flipped have the same `colorId` in the game board. The `colorId` is an index 0, 1, 2, etc
for the color of the card which we generated at the beginning of the game.  
&nbsp;  
If the match is made and the `colorId`s of each card are the same, we clone the game board
to update the `flipped` values of those cards in the `game` array. Once the `newGame`
variable is ready, we update the game and set the third `flippedIndexes` value to be
false, preventing a flip reset.  
&nbsp;   
If the match wasn't made, we instead leave the game board alone and add `true` to the
`flippedIndexes` array, triggering a flip reset.  
&nbsp;   
Lastly, for our match logic we need to fill out the `useEffect` hook we setup earlier in
the `Card` component. Replace this hook now with the following

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (flippedIndexes[2] === true && flippedIndexes.indexOf(id) > -1) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      set(state => !state)
      setFlippedCount(flippedCount + 1)
      setFlippedIndexes([])
    }, 1000)
  } else if (flippedIndexes[2] === false && id === 0) {
    setFlippedCount(flippedCount + 1)
    setFlippedIndexes([])
  }
}, [flippedIndexes])
```

Under the first condition, if the third value in `flippedIndexes` is true we don't have a
match. Instead of flipping the cards back immediately, we are using a `setTimeout` method
for 1 second to add a delay. Both conditions will add to the `flippedCount` and empty the
`flippedIndexes` array. Since we used `flippedCount % 3` earlier for our card click
listener, the count will now be reset and another turn started.

### Step 7: High Score

The game will eventually end when all the cards are matched. Since we have a
`flippedCount` variable we can keep track of the users score based on how many attempts
they made. Replace the second (empty) `useEffect` hook in the `MemoryGame` component with
the following

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const finished = !game.some(card => !card.flipped)
  if (finished && game.length > 0) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const bestPossible = game.length
      let multiplier

      if (options === 12) {
        multiplier = 5
      } else if (options === 18) {
        multiplier = 2.5
      } else if (options === 24) {
        multiplier = 1
      }

      const pointsLost = multiplier * (0.66 * flippedCount - bestPossible)

      let score
      if (pointsLost < 100) {
        score = 100 - pointsLost
      } else {
        score = 0
      }

      if (score > highScore) {
        setHighScore(score)
        const json = JSON.stringify(score)
        localStorage.setItem('memorygamehighscore', json)
      }

      const newGame = confirm('You Win!, SCORE: ' + score + ' New Game?')
      if (newGame) {
        const gameLength = game.length
        setOptions(null)
        setTimeout(() => {
          setOptions(gameLength)
        }, 5)
      } else {
        setOptions(null)
      }
    }, 500)
  }
}, [game])
```

If all of the cards are flipped (or _not some of the cards are not flipped_ 😅) the game
is finished. We can set a quick .5s timeout to allow the card animations to play out. The
next few blocks of code will determine a score for the game that is approximately 100
points for first. I added multipliers based on the difficulty, since it will definitely
take more turns to perfectly solve a hard game than an easy one.  
&nbsp;  
The game will next check to see if your score was higher than the previous high score
before asking to start a new game. Notice we used
[React Local Storage](https://www.code-boost.com/react-local-storage/) to set the
`memorygamehighscore`. This variable will get stored in each user's browser's
`localStorage` which we can also read from to load in the previous score. We can do that
now by replacing the empty _useEffect_ hook in the `App` main menu component

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const json = localStorage.getItem('memorygamehighscore')
  const savedScore = JSON.parse(json)
  if (savedScore) {
    setHighScore(savedScore)
  }
}, [])
```


### Conclusion

Congratulations 🎉 we've setup a working **Memory Game** in React using hooks,
localStorage, and spring animations!! React is a great library for building browser games
and games are a great way to build strong coding skills. 🔥
