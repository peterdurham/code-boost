This tutorial is meant to help you create a basic working *full-stack* application using
**React** and **Node**. 

![full stack demo](/img/full_stack_example_image.jpg)

Before we get started, make sure you have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer.  
<br />
If you would like to host your application on the web, you will need to sign up for or be signed up for:

- Github (code repository)
- Netlify (frontend host)
- MongoDB Atlas (database hosting)
- Heroku (backend host)

Each of these services has a free tier which will be sufficient to get the application
live in production.

### Folder structure

There are numerous ways we could setup our application. In this tutorial, we will be
hosting the **frontend** (client) and **backend** (server) separately.  
<br />  
To get started, create a folder with your project name

```bash
mkdir fullstack-app
```

## Backend Setup (Node)

Our backend will be a `Node.js` application. First, we will create a folder and then
initialize the app. Enter the following in your terminal

```bash
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
```

The command `npm init -y` will create a file named `package.json`. This file will keep
track of our dependencies , scripts, configurations, etc.  
<br />
In the `backend` directory create the following folders and files

```bash
config/
- keys_dev.js
- keys_prod.js
- keys.js
models/
- Book.js
routes/
- api/
- - books.js
.gitignore
index.js
```

### Dependencies

Dependencies are 3rd party javascript code that we can use to simplify our development
process. We can add our dependencies with

```bash
npm install --save express cors mongoose body-parser
```

then

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

In our first command, we added normal dependencies, noted by the optional `--save` flag.
These dependencies are necessary code to serve our node application in production.  
<br />
The second command uses the `--save-dev` flag, denoting it as a developer dependency.
These types of packages are not included the production application, but are useful when
developing.

### Scripts

Scripts are commands that we can enter in the terminal to interact with our application.
These will mostly be used to start or test the application. Include a `server` and a `start` script and a in your `package.json` file now like so

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "server": "nodemon index.js",
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
}
```

Run this script for development by entering `npm run server` when in the `backend` folder. The `start` script will work as well, though it is mostly for production and Heroku.   
<br />
Your `package.json` file should now look include the following:

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "server": "nodemon index.js",
  "start": "node index.js"
},
"dependencies": {
  "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
  "cors": "^2.8.5",
  "express": "^4.17.1",
  "mongoose": "^5.8.11"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "nodemon": "^2.0.2"
}
```

### Server

In the `backend` folder, next create a file called `index.js`. This file will be the one
that is run initially when you call the `start` script using `npm run server`. This code
will not change very much between projects, though it is useful to understand what each
line does. Include the following in your `index.js` file

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const cors = require('cors')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

// imports the API from the routes/api folder
const books = require('./routes/api/books')

// initializes the express application
const app = express()

// sets up CORS for Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing
app.use(cors())
// converts API responses to JSON for easy use
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))
app.use(bodyParser.json())

// imports our database credentials (stored separately for security)
const db = require('./config/keys').mongoURI

// initializes our database using the credentials
mongoose.set('useFindAndModify', false)
mongoose
  .connect(db, () => {}, {useNewUrlParser: true})
  .then(() => console.log('Mongo Database connected'))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))

// creates a route where we can interact with our API
app.use('/api/books', books)

// sets the port number depending if we are in production or development
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000

// intializes the server and logs a message
server = app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`))
```

For this tutorial, we will have only 1 API endpoint at `/api/books`. This means that when
we visit our server at `http://localhost:5000/api/books` we will be able to access the
routes we will soon create. If you wish to make additional routes, you should import and
add them here just like we did with _books_.

### Database credentials

Once you have signed up for a free [mongodb account](https://www.mongodb.com/), copy the connection string for
your application.  
<br />
Add the following to `keys.js`

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  module.exports = require('./keys_prod')
} else {
  module.exports = require('./keys_dev')
}
```

We referenced this file in the `index.js` above to get our database credentials. If we
are in development, this file will call `keys_dev.js` whereas if we have hosted our
application (production) it will call `keys_prod.js`.  
<br />
Add the following to `keys_prod.js` for when we host our `Heroku` application later

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: process.env.MONGO_URI,
  secretOrKey: process.env.SECRET_OR_KEY,
}
```

In `keys_dev.js` you will paste your connection string from _mongodb atlas_

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'mongodb+srv://paste-your-connection-string-here',
  secretOrKey: 'secret',
}
```

Your connection string will not include your password, but instead have `<pass>` which you
must replace with your user password.  
<br />
This file must not be commited to github, or anywhere publically visible. To avoid this,
we will immediately add the following to the `.gitignore` file in our project directory

```bash
config/keys_dev.js
node_modules/
```

When we later commit our project to github, this file will instruct git not to include the
file with our database credentials or our third party dependency code.

### Database Models

In order to interact with mongoDB, we must first tell it the structure of the data we want
to be working with. Each entry into our database will have a `title`, `author`, and
`description` all which will be required fields. If we want to save new details about our
books such as year published, or an image URL, we will have to add it here. In
`/models/Book.js` add the following

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const Schema = mongoose.Schema

const BookSchema = new Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  author: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
})

module.exports = Book = mongoose.model('book', BookSchema)
```

### API Routes

Lastly for our server to get up and running we will need to create our API. This is an
applied programming interface, or a recipe for the things we can get/post to our database.
Add the following to `books.js` in `/routes/api`

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

const Book = require('../../models/Book')

router.get('/test', (req, res) => res.json({msg: 'backend works'}))

// @route GET /api/books
// @desc Get books (public)
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  Book.find()
    .then(info => res.json(info))
    .catch(err => res.status(404).json({msg: 'no books found'}))
})

// @route POST /api/books
// @desc Create new book (public)
router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  const newBook = new Book({
    title: req.body.title,
    author: req.body.author,
    description: req.body.description,
  })

  newBook.save().then(info => res.json(info))
})

// @route DELETE /api/books
// @desc Delete book (public)
router.delete('/', (req, res) => {
  Book.findOneAndRemove({_id: req.body.id}).then(() => {
    res.json({success: true})
  })
})

// @route UPDATE /api/books/update/:id
// @desc Update book (public)
router.post('/update/:id', (req, res) => {
  Book.findOneAndUpdate(
    {_id: req.params.id},
    {
      $set: {
        title: req.body.title,
        author: req.body.author,
        description: req.body.description,
      },
    },
    {new: true},
  )
    .then(info => {
      res.json(info)
    })
    .catch(err => res.status(400).json({msg: 'update failed'}))
})

module.exports = router
```

This file contains the majority of our server logic. Here we can decide what happens when
we visit each of the defined endpoints. This file contains a `test` route along with
routes to `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` books in our database.  
<br />
Each endpoint includes the `HTTP` method to use, the specific `route` to use it on, and
how to interact with the database when that route is accessed. `req` stands for `request`
and has data passed along from the client while `res` stands for `response` and specifies
which information will be passed back to the client. `Book` refers to the `mongoose` data
model we setup previously.  
<br />
It is useful to understand this code, as it can be easily used as building blocks for
setting up different endpoints.

### Testing the server

Now that our server code is complete we can start the server by navigating to the
`backend` folder and entering the command `npm run server`. If the server was setup
without error, you should see the string `Mongo Database connected` that we included in
our `index.js` file.  
<br />
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/books/test` to access our
`test` route and ensure that your server is working properly.  
<br />
The next step is to create a frontend application to communicate with our server.

## Frontend Setup (React)

For this tutorial, we will be using `create-react-app` to setup the frontend of the
application. `create-react-app` is a build tool for react applications to get up and
running quickly. In the root of your project folder, enter the command

```bash
npx create-react-app frontend
```

`npx` will grab the latest version of `create-react-app` from the web and bootstrap a new
react project in a folder named `frontend` or whatever we specify.  
<br />
Change directories into your `frontend` folder and you will notice that lots of files were
built out automatically. The `src` folder contains our code, and `package.json` contains
our scripts and packages (similar to our server).

### Package.json

We will be using the package `axios` to simplify our API requests, however you also use
the native `fetch` API if you are familiar with it's syntax. Install axios by entering

```bash
npm install --save axios
```

Additionally, we will need to add a proxy to this `package.json` file to let our `client`
app know what port our `server` is running on. `proxy` will be a separate entry in our
package file and you can include it like this

```javascript
  "dependencies": {
    ...
  },
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
  "scripts": {
    ...
  },
```

It doesn't matter where in the `package.json` file you include the proxy, only that the
syntax is correct JSON and the address it points to is where your `server` is running.

### Adding Styling (CSS)

Now that our server is running and our frontend is configured, the rest of the code will
go in `App.js` and `App.css`. I have included some predefined styles to this application
so that we can focus on the API setup. Feel free to use your own stylesheets if you
prefer, or else copy the following into `App.css`

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
h2,
label {
  color: #f5c518;
}
.App {
  background-color: #000;
  color: white;
  min-height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  padding: 40px 0;
  font-size: 18px;
}
form {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
form label {
  margin-bottom: 4px;
}
form input {
  background-color: rgb(34, 34, 34);
  border: 1px solid rgb(67, 67, 67);
  outline: none;
  height: 24px;
  color: white;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
  padding: 4px;
  border-radius: 2px;
}

  background-color: rgb(49, 49, 49);
  color: rgb(87, 153, 239);
  border: 1px solid rgb(67, 67, 67);
  border-radius: 2px;
  outline: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
form button {

  padding: 0 4px;
  margin: 4px auto 0 auto;
}

}
.DataInput {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 1px solid rgb(82, 82, 82);
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 2px;
}
.DataInput h2 {
  text-decoration: underline;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
.DataInput button {
  margin-top: 12px;
}
.DataOutput {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 1px solid rgb(82, 82, 82);
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 2px;
  margin-top: 20px;
}
.DataOutput__card {
  border: 1px solid rgb(24, 24, 24);
  margin-bottom: 12px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  min-height: 150px;
  padding: 20px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
.DataOutput__card--details {
  padding-right: 20px;
}
.DataOutput__card--details div {
  display: flex;
}
.DataOutput__card--details div:not(:last-child) {
  margin-bottom: 11px;
}
.DataOutput__card span {
  color: #f5c518;
  min-width: 110px;
}
.DataOutput__card--options {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  height: 20px;
}
.DataOutput__card--options button {
  padding: 0 4px;
}
.DataOutput__card--options button:not(:last-child) {
  margin-right: 18px;
}
.DataOutput__editing {
  border: 1px solid rgb(24, 24, 24);
  margin-bottom: 12px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: rgb(24, 24, 24);
}
.DataOutput__editing form {
  padding: 20px;
}
.DataOutput__editing--option {
  display: flex;
}
.DataOutput__editing--option label {
  min-width: 110px;
}
.DataOutput__editing--option input {
  width: 300px;
}
.DataOutput__editing--cancel {
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```

### Building the App component

`create-react-app` can change slighly version-to-version. To make sure we're on the same
page start with the following in `App.js`

```jsx
import React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react'
import axios from 'axios'
import './App.css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div className="DataInput"></div>
      <div className="DataOutput"></div>
    </div>
  )
}
export default App
```

We will be using using a `functional component` and `hooks` in this application. At the
top we imported the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks along with the `axios` package.
We can eventually refactor this application into multiple files, but for simplicity's
sake we will include all of our `frontend` logic in this `App.js` component.  
<br />
Our clientside application will include the following:

- `useState` to store book logic
- `useEffect` to retrieve book data initially
- CRUD Methods (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
- Data Input component
- Data Output component

### UseState and UseEffect Hooks

These hooks work similarly to `this.setState` and `componentDidMount` methods if you've
ever written class-based React before. Add the following hooks to the top of our `app`
component before the return statement

```jsx
...
function App() {
  const [books, setBooks] = useState([]);
  const [editing, setEditing] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    getBooks();
  }, []);

return (
...
)
```

Here we will be saving the books our application is aware of in `books` with a default
empty array. `editing` will store the `id` of the book we are editing details of.  
<br />
The `useEffect` hook causes a function to run whenever the application gets rendered or rerendered.
Setting the second argument to an empty array will only trigger this function to run on
the first render, similar to `componentDidMount`. Once we write the `getBooks` method,
this will retrieve our book data from the database.

### Create and Read Methods

Next we can get our application working by adding the `Create` and `Read` Methods, along
with some `JSX`. Add the following methods below our `useEffect` hook and before the
return statement

```javascript
// Create
const onSubmitBook = async e => {
  e.preventDefault()
  const {title, author, description} = e.target
  await axios.post('/api/books', {
    title: title.value,
    author: author.value,
    description: description.value,
  })
  title.value = ''
  author.value = ''
  description.value = ''
  getBooks()
}

// Read
const getBooks = async () => {
  const res = await axios.get('/api/books')
  const data = res.data
  setBooks(data)
}
```

The first method will get called when our `DataInput` form is submitted. It will grab the
`title`, `author`, and `descrtipion` values from the form inputs, and send that data off
to the `server` as a `post` request using `axios`. Once the request is sent off, the
fields will be reset to add another book, and our `getBooks` method will be called again
to read our newly input `book`.  
<br />
The `getBooks` method will use a `get` request to our books route returning an array of
all of our book data. Once the array is retrieved, it will be set to our `books` variable
using the `setBooks` method we defined earlier.  
<br />
In order to use these methods we will also need to add some markup to our component. In
the `return` method include the following input and output data.

```jsx
return (
  <div className="App">
    <div className="DataInput">
      <h2>Enter book:</h2>
      <form onSubmit={e => onSubmitBook(e)}>
        <label htmlFor="title">Title:</label>
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        <label htmlFor="author">Author:</label>
        <input type="text" name="author" />
        <label htmlFor="description">Description:</label>
        <input type="text" name="description" />
        <button>Add Book</button>
      </form>
    </div>
    <div className="DataOutput">
      {books.map(book => (
        <div key={book._id}>{book.title}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

With this DataInput `form` added we can now input book details into our database. As long
as the three fields are not empty, a new book will be added to to the `/api/books` route
when the `Add Book` button is clicked.  
<br />
The DataOutput above is a simplified version of what we will be building out, and it
current displays the `title` of whatever books we have added to and retrieved from our
database.

### Update and Delete

So far we have added the `Create` and `Read` methods for our clientside application. Next
we can add the `Update` and `Delete` Methods below them on our `app.js` component

```javascript
// Update
const onSubmitEdits = async (e, id) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  const {title, author, description} = e.target
  await axios.post(`/api/books/update/${id}`, {
    title: title.value,
    author: author.value,
    description: description.value,
  })
  setEditing(null)
  getBooks()
}

// Delete
const deleteBook = async bookToDelete => {
  await axios({
    method: 'DELETE',
    url: '/api/books/',
    data: {
      id: bookToDelete,
    },
  })
  await getBooks()
}
```

The `Update` method behaves similarly to the `Create` method, pulling data from a form
submission and posting it to the database. The only main difference is that our form will
be located in our DataOuput section in order to modifiy an existing `book`. We passed the
`id` into this method to specify which book that is, and will also reset our `editing`
value once the edits are submitted.  
<br />
The `Delete` method passes along the `id` of the book we wish to delete to our server.
This will remove the book from our array located at `/api/books`.  
<br />
You'll notice that each of our `Create`, `Update` and `Delete` methods call the `getBooks`
method once they are complete. This will update our UI whenever a change is made in real
time.  
<br />
Lastly, we can finish up our application by modifying the `DataOuput` div that we included
above. Replace those 5 lines with our complete output

```jsx
<div className="DataOutput">
  {books.map(book => (
    <div key={book._id}>
      {editing !== book._id ? (
        <div key={book._id} className="DataOutput__card">
          <div className="DataOutput__card--details">
            <div>
              <span>Title:</span>
              {book.title}
            </div>
            <div>
              <span>Author:</span>
              {book.author}
            </div>
            <div>
              <span>Description:</span>
              {book.description}
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="DataOutput__card--options">
            <button onClick={() => setEditing(book._id)}>Edit</button>
            <button onClick={() => deleteBook(book._id)}>Delete</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div key={book._id} className="DataOutput__editing">
          <form onSubmit={e => onSubmitEdits(e, book._id)}>
            <div className="DataOutput__editing--option">
              <label htmlFor="title">Title:</label>
              <input type="text" name="title" defaultValue={book.title} />
            </div>
            <div className="DataOutput__editing--option">
              <label htmlFor="author">Author:</label>
              <input type="text" name="author" defaultValue={book.author} />
            </div>
            <div className="DataOutput__editing--option">
              <label htmlFor="description">Description:</label>
              <input type="text" name="description" defaultValue={book.description} />
            </div>
            <div>
              <button type="Submit">Submit</button>
              <button
                className="DataOutput__editing--cancel"
                onClick={() => setEditing(null)}
              >
                Cancel
              </button>
            </div>
          </form>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

As mentioned above, you can certainly refactor this `DataOuput` section into multiple
components. In this case, we are reading and mapping over the `books` data that we
retrieved from our database. By default, books will have an `Edit` button to open a
editing form, and `Delete` button to delete that book. If a book is being edited, our
application will instead display a form to input the new, edited data. Edits can be
cancelled clicking the `Cancel` button, or submitted with the `Submit` button.  
<br />
If all went well, we now have a working `fullstack` application 🎉!  This should serve
as a good stepping stone to building more complicated `APIs` and `UIs`. It certainly helps
to have an idea of what functionality you want your application to take on, and to
practice by building various `Node` and `React` applications.

### Hosting

Now that we have a serverside `Node` application running on port `5000` and a clientside
`React` application on port `3000`. We can make some final steps to get them hosted on the
web.  
<br />
For our `Node` application we will use free hosting on `Heroku` and our `React`
application will be hosted for free on `Netlify`.

## Backend Hosting (Heroku)

Once you have signed up for a free `Heroku` account, change directories back into your
`backend` application. In order to host this application and (hopefully) avoid issues,
`Heroku` prefers us to specify which version of `Node` we are running in the
`package.json` file. In order to find your version of node type

```bash
node -v
```

Depending on which version you are running, add a JSON entry for `"engines"` to your
package file specifying your `node` version. Also add a comma after your previous entry to
make sure the `JSON` is valid

```javascript
"devDependencies": {
  ...
},
"engines": {
  "node": "10.15.1"
}
```

### Deploy

Enter the following commands to commit your files to `git` so that `Heroku` can access the
code

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Now login to `Heroku` and create a new application

```bash
heroku login
heroku create
```

The first command will open `Heroku` in the browser to login, and the next command will
initialize an application with a randomly generated name for us.

### Heroku Credentials

Before we deploy our files, we will need to add our database credentials to the `Heroku`
application we just created. Find the newly generated app in `Heroku` and navigate to
`Settings`. Clicking `Reveal Config Variables` will allow us to input the values located
in our `./config/keys_dev.js` file.  
<br />
Input the values for `MONGO_URI` and `SECRET_OR_KEY` in heroku, making sure to use the
upper-cased versions to indicate environmental variables that `Heroku` will read.

```bash
  MONGO_URI       mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>...
  SECRET_OR_KEY   secret
```

Once you have input the credentials into the `Heroku` settings, enter the command

```bash
git push heroku master
```

in your terminal.  
<br />
This will build out your `node` application and deploy it to the url provided by Heroku.
This is the url where you application will live. Test it out with your `/api/books/test`
route by visiting your heroku-app

```bash
https://enigmatic-castle-69673.herokuapp.com/api/books/test
```

- Note: Using the free tier of Heroku will only spin-up your application when it is in
  use. This can take about 5 seconds if it hasn't been visited in the last 30 minutes. You
  can run this application 24/7 using the basic paid tier of Heroku at around \$7/month by
  changing the `Dyno Type` under the `Resources` panel.

## Frontend Hosting (Netlify)

### Setup

Now that we have our server hosted online, we can have our frontend routes point to that
url, rather than using the proxy we setup for development. In your frontend `package.json`
file, remove the `proxy` line we included earlier.  
<br />
Next, add the primary url of your `heroku` app to the beginning of each of your 4 endpoints in `app.js`.
Instead of the shortened versions, these will look similar to

```javascript
const res = await axios.get('https://enigmatic-castle-69673.herokuapp.com/api/books')
```

Once you have added the application base URL to each endpoint like in the above example, we are ready to deploy
the `frontend` application. You can test the frontout out with `npm start` or
proceed to deployment.

### Deploy to Github / Netlify

In this step we will be using `Github` and `Netlify` to setup and deploy a repository for
our `frontend` code. Login to `Github` and create a new repository with whatever name you
like.  
<br />
Github will provide you with a `git` address and commands to upload your code. Follow the
steps indicated on the next page which will be similar to

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin <git@github.com:your-github-username/repo-name.git>
git push -u origin master
```
> Make sure to the git remote line with your own remote from Github.

These commands, input separately will initialize a new git repo, add all files to the
staging area, commit them to git, set the git remote to your new repository, and then push
the application code to github.  
<br />
Once this step is complete, login to `Netlify` and select `New site from Git`. You will
next have the option to login to `Github` and select your new repository that was just
created.  
<br />
`Netlify` will automatically scan your application for the `build` command and `publish`
directory. These will pretty much always be correct if you are using `create-react-app` to
setup the project, so click `Deploy site` and wait for your `fullstack` application to be
hosted live on the web!
